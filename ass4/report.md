# Gradient Computations

To check the correctness of the gradient I computed the maximum of the absolute value of the difference of the weight matrices and the bias vectors, on a sequence of 25 samples:

$$
max(|V-V_{num}|) = 3.7244e-09
$$
$$
max(|U-U_{num}|) = 3.0027e-09
$$
$$
max(|W-W_{num}|) = 4.0044e-09
$$
$$
max(|b-b{num}|) = 2.5763e-09
$$
$$
max(|c-c{num}|) = 2.7359e-09
$$

Where $\cdot_{num}$ represents the numerical computed value. The numerical step used was $h=1e-5$. As we can see by the numbers obtained, the algorithm to compute the gradient is correct. 


# Training


I trained the network for 10 epochs the network and in Figure \ref{fig:3} is shown the loss curve during the training.

# Final Synthesized Text

The following two texts were generated by two different RNNs, 
both trained for 10 epochs on the Harry Potter book. The starting
character $x_0$ is the *newline* character, while the hidden state $h_0$ 
is the last hidden state produced during the training process.
