%% EvaluateClassifier
%
% Write a function that evaluates the network function, i.e. equations
% (1, 2), on multiple images and returns the results. 
% • each column of X corresponds to an image and it has size d×n.
% • W and b are the parameters of the network.
% • each column of P contains the probability for each label for the 
% image in the corresponding column of X. P has size K×n.
%
function P = EvaluateClassifierSVM(X, W, b)
    % evaluate linear part
    B = b *  ones(1,size(X,2));
    P = W * X + B;
