% • each column of X corresponds to an image and X has size d×n.
% • each column of Y (K×n) is the one-hot ground truth label for the corre-
% sponding column of X or Y is the (1×n) vector of ground truth labels.
% • J is a scalar corresponding to the sum of the loss of the network’s
% predictions for the images in X relative to the ground truth labels and
% the regularization term on W.
function J = ComputeCost(X, Y, W, b, lambda)
    % get the evaluation of the current parameters for the batch
    P = EvaluateClassifier(X, W, b);
   
    %compute the cross-entropy part
    J = -mean(log(sum(Y .* P,1)));
   
    % add the regularizing term
    J =  J + lambda * sum(sum(W .* W,'double'),'double');
